- "Your confidence muscle grows every time you push through fear and take action anyway."
- "The gap between where you are and where you want to be is filled by your daily habits."
- "Most people overestimate what they can do in a year and underestimate what they can do in five years with consistency."
- "The most successful real estate investors I know aren't necessarily the smartest; they're the most consistent."
