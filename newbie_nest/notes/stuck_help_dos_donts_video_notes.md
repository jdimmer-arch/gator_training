# Stuck, HELP! Do's & Don'ts - Detailed Notes

## Introduction

This video features Pace Morby explaining the proper protocols and best practices for when Gator Method practitioners get stuck and need help. The focus is on how to effectively seek assistance while respecting the community structure and maximizing learning opportunities.

## Key Concepts

### Understanding When You're Stuck

Pace emphasizes that getting stuck is a normal part of the real estate investing journey, especially when implementing new strategies like the Gator Method. However, how you respond to being stuck can dramatically impact your success rate and learning curve.

> "Everyone gets stuck. The difference between successful investors and those who quit is how they handle those moments when they're stuck." - Pace Morby

### The Proper Help Protocol

Pace outlines a clear hierarchy for seeking help when stuck:

1. **Self-Help First**: Always attempt to solve the problem yourself by:
   - Reviewing course materials
   - Checking the FAQ section
   - Searching previous community discussions
   - Applying critical thinking skills

2. **Community Support**: If self-help doesn't resolve the issue:
   - Post specific questions in the Facebook Gator Group
   - Be detailed about what you've already tried
   - Include relevant context (property details, communication history, etc.)

3. **Office Hours**: For more complex issues:
   - Attend the scheduled weekly office hours
   - Come prepared with specific questions
   - Be ready to share your screen if needed

4. **Direct Support**: As a last resort:
   - Submit a support ticket through the proper channels
   - Include all previous attempts to solve the issue

### Common Do's and Don'ts

#### Do's:
- Be specific about your problem
- Show what you've already tried
- Include relevant details and context
- Respect others' time
- Document solutions for future reference
- Pay it forward by helping others when you can

#### Don'ts:
- Send direct messages to Pace or team members without following protocol
- Post vague "I'm stuck" messages without details
- Expect immediate responses outside of business hours
- Skip the self-help step
- Forget to search if the question has already been answered

## Practical Implementation Steps

### Creating Your Own Troubleshooting System

Pace recommends developing a personal system for working through challenges:

1. **Document the Issue**: Write down exactly what you're stuck on
2. **Break It Down**: Divide complex problems into smaller, manageable parts
3. **Research Phase**: Look for existing solutions before asking for help
4. **Attempt Solutions**: Try at least 2-3 approaches before seeking assistance
5. **Prepare Your Question**: Format your question with:
   - What you're trying to accomplish
   - What you've already tried
   - Specific roadblocks encountered
   - Relevant screenshots or documents

### Using the Facebook Gator Group Effectively

The Facebook Gator Group is highlighted as a primary resource for getting unstuck:

1. **Use the Search Function**: Before posting, search for similar questions
2. **Tag Appropriately**: Use relevant tags to categorize your question
3. **Format for Readability**: Use clear headings, bullet points, and paragraphs
4. **Follow Up**: Update the community when you solve your problem
5. **Share Lessons**: Document what you learned for others' benefit

## Key Action Items

1. **Create a personal troubleshooting checklist** based on Pace's protocol to use whenever you get stuck
2. **Bookmark the [GatorMethod.com/help](https://GatorMethod.com/help) page** for quick access to resources
3. **Join the [Facebook Gator Group](https://facebook.com/groups/gatormethod)** if you haven't already
4. **Set up calendar reminders for weekly office hours** to ensure you don't miss them
5. **Create a "solutions journal"** to document problems you encounter and how you solved them
6. **Develop templates** for asking effective questions in the community
7. **Install the [SubTo.com/help](https://SubTo.com/help) mobile app** for on-the-go access to help resources
8. **Identify 2-3 "accountability partners"** within the community who are at a similar level
9. **Schedule a weekly personal review** of challenges faced and solutions found
10. **Commit to answering at least one community question per week** to strengthen your own knowledge
