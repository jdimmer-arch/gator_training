# Why We Kick People - Gator Method Video Notes

## Introduction

In this video, Pace Morby discusses the important topic of community standards and why certain individuals may be removed from the Gator Method community. This video provides crucial insights into the values and expectations that form the foundation of the Gator community and how maintaining these standards benefits all members.

## Key Concepts

### Community Standards

The Gator Method community is built on specific values and standards that all members are expected to uphold. These standards are not arbitrary but are designed to create an environment where everyone can thrive and succeed in their real estate investing journey.

### Reasons for Removal

Pace outlines several key reasons why individuals might be removed from the community:

1. **Disrespect to Other Members**: Treating fellow community members with disrespect, belittling others, or creating a toxic environment.

2. **Failure to Follow Guidelines**: Consistently ignoring established community guidelines and protocols, especially after multiple warnings.

3. **Unethical Business Practices**: Engaging in business practices that violate the ethical standards of the Gator Method, including dishonesty with sellers, buyers, or other investors.

4. **Misrepresentation**: Falsely representing oneself or one's achievements within the community.

5. **Negative Impact on Community Culture**: Consistently bringing negative energy that affects the overall positive culture of the community.

### The Warning System

Before removal, members typically receive:
- Initial guidance on appropriate behavior
- Clear warnings about specific violations
- Opportunities to correct behavior
- Final notice before removal

### The Greater Good Principle

Pace emphasizes that removals are never personal but are always for the greater good of the community. One person's negative influence can impact hundreds or thousands of other members who are genuinely trying to learn and grow.

## Practical Applications

### Self-Assessment

Members are encouraged to regularly self-assess their contributions to the community:
- Are you adding value?
- Are you supporting other members?
- Are you following community guidelines?
- Are you representing the Gator Method values in your business practices?

### Accountability Partners

Pace recommends finding accountability partners within the community who can provide honest feedback about your behavior and contributions.

### Reporting System

The community has a reporting system for members to flag concerning behavior, which is then reviewed by community managers before any action is taken.

## Key Action Items

1. **Review Community Guidelines**: Take time to thoroughly review all Gator Method community guidelines to ensure you understand expectations.

2. **Practice Respectful Communication**: Always communicate with respect, even during disagreements or when providing feedback.

3. **Uphold Ethical Standards**: Ensure all your business practices align with the ethical standards taught in the Gator Method.

4. **Contribute Positively**: Look for ways to add value to the community through sharing successes, lessons learned, and supporting others.

5. **Accept Feedback Graciously**: If you receive feedback about your behavior, take it as an opportunity to grow rather than becoming defensive.

6. **Report Concerns Appropriately**: If you witness behavior that violates community standards, report it through proper channels rather than engaging directly.

7. **Find Accountability Partners**: Connect with 1-2 trusted community members who can provide honest feedback about your contributions and behavior.

8. **Represent the Brand Well**: Remember that as a Gator Method member, you represent the brand in the marketplace.

## Powerful Quotes from Pace Morby

"This community is built on respect, integrity, and a genuine desire to help each other succeed. If those values don't resonate with you, this probably isn't the right place."

"The quality of our community is directly related to the standards we maintain. We won't compromise on those standards."
