## Key Concepts

### Personal Safety Fundamentals

### Communication Protocols

### Property Inspection Safety
- Wear appropriate protective gear when inspecting distressed properties
- Be aware of potential hazards: structural issues, pests, mold, etc.
- Never enter crawl spaces or attics without proper equipment
- Bring a flashlight, even during daytime inspections
- Take photos of hazardous conditions rather than risking physical inspection

### Digital Security Measures
- Use secure communication channels for sensitive information
