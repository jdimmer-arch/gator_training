## Key Action Items

1. **Complete a Cash Inventory**: Create a comprehensive inventory of all available cash, including checking, savings, money market accounts, and other liquid assets.

3. **Create a Cash Deployment Plan**: Develop a written plan for how you will allocate your available cash across different investment types and timelines.

4. **Build a Deal Analysis System**: Create a standardized system for analyzing potential deals that includes cash requirements, expected returns, and timeline considerations.

5. **Establish Cash Recycling Triggers**: Define specific criteria for when to extract cash from investments through refinancing, sales, or other exit strategies.

6. **Develop Banking Relationships**: Identify and establish relationships with at least two banks or lenders who can help leverage your cash for larger deals.

7. **Create a Proof of Funds Package**: Prepare a professional proof of funds package that can be quickly provided when negotiating deals.

8. **Schedule Regular Cash Position Reviews**: Set up a monthly review of your cash position, deployment progress, and upcoming opportunities.
