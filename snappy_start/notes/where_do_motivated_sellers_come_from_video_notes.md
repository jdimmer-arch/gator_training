# Where Do Motivated Sellers Come From Video Notes

## Introduction

This video from the Snappy Start chapter features Pace Morby explaining the various sources of motivated sellers in real estate investing. Understanding where to find motivated sellers is crucial for Gator Method practitioners, as these sellers form the foundation of creative financing opportunities.

## Key Concepts

### What Makes a Seller "Motivated"

Pace defines motivated sellers as property owners facing specific challenges that make traditional real estate transactions difficult or undesirable. These challenges create opportunities for creative financing solutions that benefit both parties.

Key characteristics of motivated sellers include:

- Facing time pressure (need to sell quickly)
- Dealing with property issues (repairs, code violations, etc.)
- Experiencing financial distress (behind on payments, tax issues)
- Going through major life transitions (divorce, inheritance, relocation)
- Owning properties that don't qualify for conventional financing
- Prioritizing certainty and convenience over maximum price
