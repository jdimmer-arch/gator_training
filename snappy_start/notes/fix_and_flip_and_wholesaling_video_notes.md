## Powerful Quotes from Pace Morby

"Wholesaling isn't about buying and selling housesâ€”it's about solving problems for motivated sellers and creating opportunities for cash buyers."

"The profit in a fix and flip is made when you buy, not when you sell. If you get the purchase price right, everything else becomes much easier."

"Most new investors think wholesaling is easier than flipping, but it's just a different skill set. You're trading the challenges of renovation for the challenges of marketing and negotiation."

"The best flippers think like wholesalers when they buy, and like retail agents when they sell. It's about mastering both ends of the transaction."
