# Intro - Gator Method Video Notes

## Introduction

This introductory video to the Snappy Start chapter features Pace Morby providing an overview of the Gator Method, its philosophy, and what students can expect to learn throughout the course. The video serves as a foundation for understanding the unique approach to real estate investing that has made Pace successful.

## Key Concepts

### What is the Gator Method?

The Gator Method is Pace Morby's systematic approach to real estate investing that focuses on creative financing strategies and relationship building rather than traditional cash purchases. The name "Gator" represents the aggressive yet strategic nature of the approach - like an alligator, investors should be patient, observant, and decisive when the right opportunity presents itself.

### The Four Gator Levels

Pace introduces the four levels of the Gator Method, which will be covered in detail throughout the course:

1. **Gator 1.0**: Short-term lending and escrow-protected transactions
2. **Gator 2.0**: Subject-to deals and creative financing structures
3. **Gator 3.0**: Private money lending strategies
4. **Gator 4.0**: Advanced techniques for scaling and portfolio building

### The Mindset Difference

A significant portion of the video focuses on the mindset required for success with the Gator Method:

- Shifting from a scarcity mindset to an abundance mindset
- Understanding that deals are created, not just found
- Recognizing that relationships are more valuable than transactions
- Embracing creativity and flexibility in deal structures

### The Role of Relationships

Pace emphasizes that the Gator Method is fundamentally built on relationships with five key groups:

1. Sellers
2. Buyers
3. Lenders
4. Real estate agents
5. Other investors

Building and nurturing these relationships is presented as the cornerstone of long-term success in real estate investing.
