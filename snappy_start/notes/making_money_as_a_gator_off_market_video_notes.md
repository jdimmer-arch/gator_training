## Introduction

This video from the Snappy Start chapter features Pace Morby explaining how to generate income as a Gator Method practitioner through off-market real estate transactions. The focus is on practical strategies for finding, negotiating, and monetizing deals outside of traditional real estate listing platforms.

### Understanding Off-Market Opportunities

Pace defines off-market transactions as real estate deals that occur without being listed on the MLS (Multiple Listing Service) or other public platforms. These opportunities offer several advantages:

- Less competition from other buyers
- Greater negotiation flexibility

- Direct communication with motivated sellers
- Ability to structure creative financing solutions
- Higher profit margins due to fewer intermediaries

### The Four Primary Off-Market Income Strategies

The video outlines four main strategies for making money as a Gator in off-market transactions:

   - Typical assignment fees range from $5,000 to $25,000 per deal
   - Requires minimal capital but strong marketing and negotiation skills
   - Focus on building a reliable cash buyer network
   - Creating systems for consistent lead generation

2. **Fix and Flip**
   - Purchasing distressed properties below market value
