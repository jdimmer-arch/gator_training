## Powerful Quotes from Pace Morby

"The most valuable skill in this business isn't talkingâ€”it's listening. When sellers tell you their problems, they're also telling you how to structure your solution."

"Every seller conversation is a fact-finding mission. Your job isn't to make a deal happen; it's to discover if there's a deal that makes sense for everyone."

"The best deals come from solving real problems for sellers. If you focus on being a problem-solver first and a deal-maker second, the money will follow."

"Most investors rush to make an offer. I prefer to rush to understand the situation completely. The right offer becomes obvious once you have the full picture."
