## Powerful Quotes from Pace Morby

"Your fees aren't just about what you charge—they're a statement about the value you believe you provide and the professional you aspire to be."

"Most new Gators undercharge because they lack confidence, not because they lack value. Charge what you're worth, then make sure you're worth what you charge."

"The art of negotiation isn't about getting the highest possible fee—it's about finding the fee that makes the deal work for everyone involved."

"When someone objects to your fee, they're not saying you're too expensive—they're saying you haven't demonstrated enough value yet."
