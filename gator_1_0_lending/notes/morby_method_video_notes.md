## Powerful Quotes from Pace Morby

"The Morby Method isn't just about how to do deals—it's about how to build a business and a life that creates value for everyone it touches."

"Most investors are looking for properties. I'm looking for problems to solve. When you solve enough problems, the properties and profits follow naturally."

"Your network is your net worth, but only if you're genuinely invested in the success of everyone in that network. Relationships aren't transactions."

"The difference between average investors and exceptional ones isn't their access to capital—it's their ability to creatively solve problems that others can't or won't solve."
