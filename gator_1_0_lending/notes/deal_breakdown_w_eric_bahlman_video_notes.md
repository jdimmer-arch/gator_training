## Powerful Quotes from Eric Bahlman

"The numbers on paper are important, but what really made this deal work was having the right relationships in place before the opportunity even appeared."

"Most investors overthink the complexity and underprepare for the basics. This deal worked because we had our documentation and processes dialed in before we started."

"The difference between theory and practice is that in theory, there are no surprises. This deal taught me that your systems for handling surprises are just as important as your deal analysis."

"I've done dozens of these deals now, and the pattern is clear: preparation before opportunity is what separates successful Gator 1.0 investors from those who just talk about it."
