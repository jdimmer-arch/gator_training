# EMD Video Notes

## Introduction

This video in the Gator 1.0 - SHORT TERM/ESCROW PROTECTED LENDING chapter features Pace Morby explaining the concept of Earnest Money Deposits (EMD) and how they can be leveraged as a Gator 1.0 strategy. The video provides a detailed breakdown of how to fund EMDs for other investors, creating a low-risk income opportunity while helping facilitate real estate transactions.

## Key Concepts

### What is an Earnest Money Deposit (EMD)?

Pace explains that an Earnest Money Deposit is:
- A good faith deposit made by a buyer to show serious intent to purchase a property
- Typically 1-2% of the purchase price in traditional transactions
- Often $500-$2,000 in wholesale or creative financing deals
- Held by a neutral third party (title company, escrow company, or attorney)
- Applied toward the purchase price at closing

### The EMD Funding Opportunity

The core Gator 1.0 strategy presented involves:
- Providing the capital for other investors' earnest money deposits
- Charging a fee for this service (typically $500-$1,000 per transaction)
- Securing the investment through proper documentation
- Using escrow protection to eliminate risk
- Creating a win-win scenario for all parties involved

### Risk Mitigation Through Escrow

Pace emphasizes the importance of escrow protection in EMD funding:
- All funds are held by a licensed escrow agent
- Money is only released according to the terms of the agreement
- Legal documentation protects the funder's interests
- The process creates a secure environment for the transaction

### Building Relationships Through EMD Funding

A significant portion of the video focuses on how EMD funding helps build valuable relationships:
- With wholesalers who need consistent access to EMD funds
- With title companies who facilitate transactions
- With sellers who benefit from smoother transactions
- With the broader investor community as a reliable capital partner

## Practical Applications

### Setting Up an EMD Funding System

Pace outlines the practical steps for implementing an EMD funding system:
- Establish relationships with title/escrow companies willing to work with investors
- Create or obtain proper EMD funding documentation
- Set clear parameters for the types of deals you'll fund
- Develop a vetting process for potential borrowers
- Establish a quick response system for time-sensitive opportunities

### EMD Funding Process Flow

The video breaks down the typical process flow for an EMD funding transaction:
1. Investor identifies a deal and needs EMD funds
2. Gator reviews the deal basics and borrower credentials
3. Gator and investor sign an EMD funding agreement
4. Gator wires funds directly to the escrow company
5. Transaction either closes (EMD applied to purchase) or fails (EMD returned)
6. Gator collects fee regardless of transaction outcome

### Scaling an EMD Funding Business

Pace discusses how to scale an EMD funding business:
- Start with a small pool of capital dedicated to EMD funding
- Reinvest profits to increase capital base
- Build a network of reliable borrowers
- Create systems for quick evaluation and funding
- Track performance metrics to optimize operations

## Key Action Items

1. **Research Local Escrow Laws**: Understand the legal requirements for EMD handling in your state.

2. **Establish Title/Escrow Relationships**: Connect with at least three title/escrow companies that work with investors and understand EMD funding.

3. **Create EMD Funding Documentation**: Develop or obtain proper legal documentation for EMD funding arrangements.

4. **Set Funding Parameters**: Establish clear criteria for the types of EMDs you will fund, including maximum amounts, geographic areas, and borrower requirements.

5. **Build a Borrower Vetting System**: Create a process for quickly evaluating potential borrowers and their deals.

6. **Network with Wholesalers**: Begin building relationships with active wholesalers who regularly need EMD funds.

7. **Create a Quick Response System**: Develop a system that allows you to evaluate and fund EMDs within 24-48 hours.

8. **Track Performance Metrics**: Implement a tracking system for all EMD transactions, including fees earned, capital deployed, and time to return.

## Powerful Quotes from Pace Morby

"EMD funding is one of the simplest ways to start making money in real estate without ever owning a property."

"The beauty of funding EMDs is that your money is always protected by escrow. It's either going toward a purchase or coming back to you."

"Most new wholesalers struggle with having enough capital for multiple EMDs. By solving this problem for them, you become an invaluable partner."

"I've seen people build six-figure businesses just from EMD funding. It's a simple concept with powerful results when done consistently."
