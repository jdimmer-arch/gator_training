## Powerful Quotes from Pace Morby

"The biggest mistake investors make is thinking negotiations are about numbers. They're not—they're about emotions wrapped in numbers."

"When you understand what's driving someone emotionally, you can structure a deal that gives them what they really want, not just what they say they want."

"The best negotiators aren't the ones who never feel emotions—they're the ones who understand emotions and use that understanding constructively."

"Trust is the currency of negotiation. Without it, no term, no matter how favorable, will close the deal."
