Building on Part 1, this video delves deeper into the practical implementation of the 10 funding approaches, providing detailed insights into how investors can effectively transition from being capital users to becoming strategic capital providers in the real estate market.

## Key Concepts

### Deep Dive into the 10 Funding Strategies

Pace provides a more detailed exploration of each funding strategy:
- **Private Lending with Secured Positions**: Creating loans secured by real estate with clear documentation and exit strategies
- **Joint Venture Partnerships**: Structuring deals where one party provides funding and another provides sweat equity
- **Equity Participation Models**: Investing capital for an ownership stake in properties with profit-sharing arrangements
- **Debt with Profit Participation**: Lending money with both interest returns and a percentage of profits
- **Hard Money Lending**: Short-term, asset-based loans with higher interest rates for quick transactions
- **DSCR Loans**: Financing based on a property's ability to generate income rather than borrower qualifications
- **Construction Financing**: Providing capital specifically for renovation or new construction projects
- **Bridge Lending**: Short-term financing to "bridge" gaps between transactions or longer-term financing
- **Gap Funding**: Providing the difference between primary financing and total project costs
- **Transactional Funding**: Very short-term capital (often 24-72 hours) for double closings and wholesaling

### Risk-Return Spectrum

The video explains how each funding strategy fits into a risk-return spectrum:
