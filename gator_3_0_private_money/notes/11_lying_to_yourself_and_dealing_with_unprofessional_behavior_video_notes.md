## Powerful Quotes

> "The most dangerous person in any lending transaction is the one in the mirror. When you lie to yourself about red flags, you're setting yourself up for failure no matter how good the deal looks on paper."

> "Most lenders have clear standards for property condition, loan-to-value ratios, and documentation—but vague or non-existent standards for borrower behavior. Professional behavior is just as important as property value in determining lending outcomes."

> "The difference between amateur and professional lenders isn't the returns they target—it's their discipline in maintaining rigorous honesty with themselves and enforcing consistent professional standards with borrowers."

> "Hope is not a strategy, and friendship is not a lending qualification. Professional lenders create specific, documented standards for borrower behavior and enforce them consistently regardless of personal relationships."

> "When a borrower consistently demonstrates unprofessional behavior during the lending process, that's not just a yellow flag—it's a bright red one with flashing lights. How they act before you fund is their best behavior; it only gets worse from there."
