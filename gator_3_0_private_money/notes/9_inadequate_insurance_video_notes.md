## Powerful Quotes

> "Insurance isn't an optional extra in private lending—it's the foundation of your capital preservation strategy. When you accept inadequate insurance, you're essentially self-insuring the gap, which means you're taking on risk you're not being compensated for."

> "Most lenders check the box on insurance without verifying the details. The best collateral in the world won't save you if it burns down and the insurance policy has the wrong loss payee or inadequate coverage."

> "The difference between amateur and professional lenders isn't the returns they target—it's their discipline in verifying and enforcing proper insurance coverage throughout the loan term."

> "Hope is not an insurance strategy. Professional lenders create specific, documented insurance requirements and verification procedures before the first dollar is ever funded."

> "When a borrower pushes back on insurance requirements, that's not just a yellow flag—it's a bright red one with flashing lights. Professional borrowers understand that proper insurance protects everyone involved."
