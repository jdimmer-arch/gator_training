> "The difference between amateur and professional lenders isn't the returns they target—it's their discipline in controlling the flow of capital throughout the project."

> "When a borrower pushes hard for all the money upfront, that's not a red flag—it's a red billboard with flashing lights. Professional borrowers understand and respect the disbursement process."

> "Your money should follow progress, not precede it. When you reverse that order, you've fundamentally changed the risk profile of the entire deal."
