7. **Establish Clear Boundaries**: Define non-negotiable lending criteria and personal rules that will not be violated regardless of the perceived opportunity.

8. **Build a Recovery Playbook**: Create a step-by-step action plan for addressing troubled loans at various stages of distress, from early warning signs to full default.

## Powerful Quotes

> "The fastest way to lose money in private lending isn't by making one huge mistake—it's by making a series of small compromises that each seem reasonable at the time."

> "When you're the bank, you don't get to celebrate big wins—you get to celebrate not losing. Your best outcome is getting your money back with the interest you expected."

> "The time to think about what happens if everything goes wrong is before you write the check, not after the borrower stops answering your calls."

> "The difference between amateur and professional lenders isn't in the returns they target—it's in the risks they refuse to take and the boundaries they refuse to cross."

> "Documentation isn't about trust—it's about clarity. The best borrowers want clear documentation as much as you do because it protects everyone and sets proper expectations."
